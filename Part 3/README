	Filename: multiple
	Problem: the password file is hidden within several directories. I know the executables aren't what I need 
				but I had to find the right file. I opened the first text file "-file2" in the maybehere00 
				folder and found a really long string. I opened the ".file2" and found that it was also a really 
				long string but not as long as the -file2. I did the same for mabyehere01 and found the same 
				pattern.
	Solution: I opened every directory and opened the .file2 until I found a 32 character string like the other 
				passwords in mabyehere07
