Function: 
	The program will display an integer representing the number of command line arguments accompanying the
	./command when the executable is run on the command line. The program will also print the arguments in the 
	reverse order.
	
Number of Arguments: 
	The program makes use of two arguments passed into main: argc and an array of character 
	strings. When executed, the program prints one less than the value of argc since it defaults to 1 when the 
	program is run. 
	
Reversed Order Arguments:
	To print the arguments in reverse order, a for-loop is used and initialized to one less than the number of 
	arguments passed in. The loop prints from the end of the charactar through the first item.
